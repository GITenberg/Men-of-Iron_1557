description: "Men of Iron is an 1891 novel by the American author Howard Pyle, who\
  \ also illustrated it. Set in the 15th century, it is a juvenile \"coming of age\"\
  \ work in which a young squire, Myles Falworth, seeks not only to become a knight\
  \ but to eventually redeem his father's honor. In Chapter 24 the knighthood ceremony\
  \ is presented and described as it would be in a non-fiction work concerning knighthood\
  \ and chivalry. Descriptions of training equipment are also given throughout.\n\
  It comprises 68,334 words and is divided into 33 unnamed chapters, an introduction,\
  \ and a conclusion. It was made into a movie in 1954, The Black Shield of Falworth.\n\
